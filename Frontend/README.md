# Billing Management System (FinTech Implementation)

## 📌 Overview
A robust backend solution designed to streamline digital payments and billing cycles. This project focuses on the intersection of **Finance and Technology (FinTech)**, ensuring secure, accurate, and efficient transaction handling for utility bills and mobile recharges.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Secure Payment Integration:** Integrated with **Razorpay API** for real-time, secure financial transactions.
* **Advanced Security:** Implemented **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** and Spring Security to protect sensitive user data.
* **Role-Based Access:** Managed administrative and user permissions to ensure data privacy and financial audit trails.
* **Automated Billing:** Logic-driven system for calculating and processing electricity and mobile service charges.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Backend:** Java 8, Spring Boot, Spring Security
* **Database:** MySQL (Relational data management for transaction history)
* **API:** Razorpay Payment Gateway
* **Tools:** Maven, Git

## 📈 Business Logic Applied
This project was built with a focus on **Data Integrity**—ensuring that every transaction is recorded accurately without discrepancy, a core requirement for financial operations and BPO compliance standards.



















# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
